# GraphQL TodoMVC Service Go Application

## Project Intention

This project is intended for personal learning/exploration of Golang. This will be a work in progress, and will not immediately be a GraphQL server. It will start out as RESTful, eventually evolving into a GraphQL server over time.

## Project Progress

[NOTE: Each linked commit below is be a working version of the application. Earlier versions, may have some bugs. Listed from latest to oldest.]

- [ ] Epic: Convert to GraphQL
- [ ] Feature: [RESTful TodoMVC Service Application](https://github.com/cerebralideas/todomvc-server-rest-typescript/blob/master/README.md) for complete parity in Golang
- [ ] Tech: Add a light-weight framework to clean up and organize code
- [ ] Feature: Add a super simple, non-persisted, in-memory CRUD for a collection of todos with no frameworks, external modules
- [x] Feature: Build a single REST API endpoint for calling for a todo collection ([HEAD](https://github.com/cerebralideas/todomvc-server-graphql-go))

## Up and Running

```
# Within this project directory
go run main.go
```

Visit `localhost:8000/todos` in your browser.
